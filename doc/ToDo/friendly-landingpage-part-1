Here’s a clean way to split this into manageable pieces (each piece = one small PR). This order minimizes “style drift” and avoids rework when you add CMS later.

Chunk A — Establish the “design system” used by authenticated pages

Goal: identify the exact components/classes that give your authed pages their look (cards, buttons, inputs, spacing, dark mode).

Deliverables
	•	A short list of “source of truth” files for styling (usually 3–6 files)
	•	Decide: reuse existing “Card/Button/Input” styles vs introduce a new component layer

What I need you to paste (small + precise):
	1.	frontend/src/index.css (or wherever Tailwind base/theme lives)
	2.	frontend/tailwind.config.*
	3.	Your authed layout shell: frontend/src/routes/RootLayout.tsx
	4.	One authed page that looks “correct”: frontend/src/routes/Login.tsx (or the page in your screenshot)

This lets me match the landing page exactly without guessing.

Chunk B — Make Landing use the same layout primitives

Goal: landing page uses the same container widths, typography, cards, and button styles as the authed app.

Deliverables
	•	Landing uses the same <header>, card classes, button classes
	•	No custom CSS for landing (ideally), only existing classes/components

Implementation approach (pick one):
	•	Option 1 (recommended): extract shared components (Button, Card, Container) and use them everywhere
	•	Option 2: reuse existing classnames (if you already have .card, .btn etc.) and update Landing to match

⸻

Chunk C — Align dark mode behavior and the switch UX

Goal: same dark mode behavior everywhere (landing + login + authed pages) and one consistent switch design.

Deliverables
	•	Single source of truth for theme:
	•	reads localStorage.theme
	•	applies document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark", …)
	•	A shared <ThemeToggle /> component used on:
	•	Landing header
	•	Login page (and anywhere else you want)

What I need you to paste (if not already in Chunk A):
	•	frontend/src/App.tsx (or wherever you currently set theme)
	•	frontend/src/routes/Settings.tsx (theme toggle logic)

⸻

Chunk D — Create a CMS-backed landing content model (admin editable)

Goal: /admin controls landing content; frontend fetches it.

Deliverables
	•	Backend:
	•	LandingPage singleton model (hero title/subtitle/body/cta)
	•	Django admin registration
	•	GET /api/site/landing/ (AllowAny)
	•	Frontend:
	•	Landing fetches content and renders it
	•	Fallback defaults if API returns nothing

What I need when we get here:
	•	Django app structure where you want this to live (e.g., journal, accounts, or new sitecontent)

⸻

Chunk E — Optional polish

Goal: make landing feel “production”:
	•	add footer, feature list, screenshots, etc.
	•	add public “Best trade today/ever” teaser later (after nickname/best-trade endpoint)

⸻

Summary: the “manageable pieces”
	1.	Identify authed styling source files (paste 4 files)
	2.	Refactor landing to reuse the same primitives
	3.	Unify dark mode + theme toggle component
	4.	Add CMS (/admin) landing content model + API + frontend fetch
	5.	Polish

If you paste the files from Chunk A (index.css, tailwind config, RootLayout, Login), I’ll give you exact diffs to make the landing match your authenticated styling 1:1 (including the dark-mode toggle look).
