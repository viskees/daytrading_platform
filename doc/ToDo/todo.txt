## user friendly landing page
Break it into 6 small chunks (each can be one PR)

1) Public vs Auth routing split (frontend-only)

Goal: / becomes a real landing page (public), and /app becomes the authenticated app root.
Deliverables
	•	New route/page: LandingPage
	•	Update requireAuth() logic so it redirects to /login (instead of falling back to Settings)
	•	Add /app route that renders a new Dashboard (placeholder for now)

Success criteria
	•	Logged out → see landing on /
	•	Logged in → /app works
	•	No backend changes yet

⸻

2) Add UserProfile with nickname + privacy fields (backend-only)

Goal: stop exposing email as identity; allow a public nickname.
Deliverables
	•	UserProfile model + signals + admin registration
	•	API endpoint: GET/PATCH /api/auth/me/ includes profile.nickname and updates it
	•	Migration

Success criteria
	•	You can edit nickname via API
	•	Nickname persists
	•	Still no best-trade logic yet

⸻

3) Account UI (frontend-only)

Goal: nickname editable in your existing “account/settings” area.
Deliverables
	•	Add nickname input + “show on leaderboards” toggle
	•	PATCH /api/auth/me/

Success criteria
	•	UI saves nickname + toggle
	•	No email shown anywhere except account screen

⸻

4) Make trades queryable for “best trade” (backend-only)

Goal: best trade endpoints should be efficient/consistent.
Deliverables
	•	Add stored fields on Trade: realized_pnl_value (+ optional r_multiple_value)
	•	Ensure value computed on close/save
	•	Data migration to backfill existing trades

Success criteria
	•	DB contains realized PnL numbers for closed trades

⸻

5) Best trades API (backend-only)

Goal: single endpoint for dashboard + landing.
Deliverables
	•	GET /api/stats/best-trades/
	•	Returns { best_today, best_ever } with nickname only (no email)
	•	Permission rules:
	•	Authenticated version includes more detail (optional)
	•	Public version shows limited fields (recommended)

Success criteria
	•	Endpoint returns correct results
	•	No emails leak in JSON

⸻

6) CMS landing page content (backend + frontend)

Goal: editable landing page via /admin (simple CMS).
Deliverables
	•	LandingPage singleton model + admin
	•	GET /api/site/landing/
	•	Landing page fetches and renders content
	•	Optional: landing shows best trade tiles

Success criteria
	•	Content editable in admin
	•	Landing updates without redeploy

⸻

Answer: show “best trade today/ever” on public landing too?

Yes, it can be appealing, but only if you do it in a privacy-safe, marketing-safe way.

Recommended approach
	•	Show on landing: ✅ Yes, but in “teaser mode”
	•	show nickname (or “Anonymous”)
	•	show ticker and PnL (optional)
	•	hide exact timestamps, strategy tags, notes, screenshots
	•	Show on dashboard: ✅ Yes, full detail (still no emails)

Why this is the best compromise
	•	Landing gets a “social proof / excitement” element
	•	You avoid leaking trading behavior or personal identifiers
	•	You keep the dashboard as the “real” experience after login

One extra safeguard I’d add

Add show_on_leaderboards (opt-out) and only include trades where this is true.

How to ask me for the “exact diffs” in a manageable way

Instead of asking for everything at once, ask like this:
	1.	“Generate the exact diffs for Chunk 1 (routing split) based on the zip.”
	2.	Then: “Now generate diffs for Chunk 2 (UserProfile + /auth/me).”
	3.	Repeat.

This guarantees:
	•	diffs stay small
	•	you can test after each chunk
	•	rollback is easy
