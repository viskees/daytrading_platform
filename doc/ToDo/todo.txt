roadmap
- stocks tab becomes watchlist
- scale in and out of a trade; on open trade panel, actions column
- total market capital when opening a trade (<5000k --> low commission?)
- commission field in risk settings --> percentage per share toevoegen
- commission field when opening and closing a trade

Done:
- trade overnight - visible on the journal calendar (on closing date), but is not registered nor is it listed. session stats and account summary is not updated on the closure date as well
