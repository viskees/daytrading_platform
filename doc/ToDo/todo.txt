Next I want to realize a few (big) changes and new features:
- fully multi-user
- account section to manage your personal account, change pw, manage MFA, etc
- email integration for user registration, pw reset, etc
- friendly user landing page, with a text section where I can explain the site, manageble via the admin interface
- the landing page also shows the best trade ever and the best trade of the day
- feature request page (everybody can add feature request on which others can vote)- visible for all users section and a roadmap section which only myself can edit via the admin interface
- integrated community chat
