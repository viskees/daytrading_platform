Summary of what I recommend you implement next (aligned with your bullets)
	1.	Define trading day as PM+RTH using 04:00 ET boundary
	2.	Store bars under day-scoped Redis keys scanner:bars:{day}:{symbol}
	3.	HOD computed over all bars since day start (not sliding)
	4.	rVol baselines:
	•	rvol_1m baseline: 30–60 mins
	•	rvol_5m baseline: 60–120 mins
	5.	Reset: new day means new Redis keyspace; DB retains triggers (with retention cleanup)

Dev/ops troubleshooting checklist (scanner)

If scanner “doesn’t work”, here’s the real failure chain to verify:
	1.	IBKR ingestor running?
	•	scanner:ingestor:heartbeat updating
	•	Redis lists scanner:bars:SYMBOL receiving new bars
	2.	Celery beat firing scanner_tick every minute?
	•	Confirm periodic task exists and enabled
	•	Confirm worker logs show scanner_tick: created=...
	3.	Engine enabled + universe populated?
	•	ScannerConfig.enabled=True
	•	Universe tickers enabled + uppercase clean symbols
	4.	Channels working?
	•	WS connects, joins user_{id} group, receives hello
	•	Test with emit_test_event and emit_test_hot5
	5.	Pushover only after the task bug is fixed
	•	Then verify per-user gating: follow_alerts, pushover_enabled, cleared_until, thresholds.
