- forgot password @ login gui
- nice landing page
- feature request tab (roadmap/bugs/features --> voting)

Next I want to realize a few (big) changes and new features:
- fully multi-user
- account section to manage your personal account, change pw, manage MFA, etc
- email integration for user registration, pw reset, etc
- friendly user landing page, with a text section where I can explain the site, manageble via the admin interface
- the landing page also shows the best trade ever and the best trade of the day
- feature request page (everybody can add feature request on which others can vote)- visible for all users section and a roadmap section which only myself can edit via the admin interface
- the dasboard has several modals, but I want them to be vertical alligned. Next to this I want the logged in user to be able to expand and collaps modals and change the order of the modals
- integrated community chat


Gaps / things to polish
	•	No true “multi-tenant” concept (which is fine): all users share one global instance. If later you want organizations/teams, that’s extra work, but for simple multi-user you’re basically done.
	•	A few localStorage helpers (e.g. LAST_EQUITY_KEY in App.tsx) are not keyed by user, so if two users share a browser profile they’d leak that local value. Not security-critical, but worth keying by user.id.
	•	Frontend structure is in between:
	•	App.tsx is a tabbed SPA (Dashboard / Stocks / Risk / Journal / Account).
	•	There is also a newer react-router setup in routes.tsx (with RootLayout, Journal, Settings, Login, Register).
	•	For multi-user clarity, you’ll probably want to fully commit to the router-based layout and treat App.tsx as “dashboard page”, not the whole app.

Verdict: multi-user isolation and auth are already solid. “Fully multi-user” is mostly cleanup and UX rather than backend changes.

What’s missing / to tidy up
	•	Routing consistency: currently, routes.tsx does not expose /account – it only has /, /journal, /settings. Account is only reachable via the internal tabs in App.tsx. You’ll likely want a proper /account route.
	•	Duplicate implementations: you have AccountPage inside App.tsx and another Account.tsx in pages/. You should consolidate these into one canonical component.
	•	There’s no UI to edit display name / profile details (even though the register serializer can set first_name/display_name).
	•	No explicit UI for deleting account or other privacy settings (if you ever want that).

Verdict: account + password change + MFA are already implemented, just not fully cleaned up / routed nicely.

What’s missing
	•	No password reset flow yet:
	•	There is no serializer / view / endpoint to request a reset email (e.g. /api/auth/password-reset/) or confirm it with a token.
	•	No frontend UI for “Forgot your password?”.
	•	Production email config:
	•	.env.prod currently has no EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_PORT, DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL, etc, so in prod it will fall back to localhost:25, which is unlikely to work on your VPS.
	•	You’ll need to add SMTP settings (Mailgun, Postmark, SES, etc) for production.
	•	Email templates are currently very basic plain text (subject and single line “Click to verify: …”).

Verdict: Registration email verification is done and wired. Password reset + production SMTP config are the big missing pieces.

TL;DR status per roadmap item
	•	✅ Fully multi-user (backend & auth) – implemented and secure; just some UX and cleanup (e.g. localStorage per user, clearer routing).
	•	✅ / 🔧 Account section with password change + MFA – implemented in both backend and App’s AccountPage, needs consolidation and routing polish.
	•	✅ / ⛔ Email integration
	•	Registration + email verification: ✅
	•	Password reset + production SMTP config: ⛔ not yet built.
	•	⛔ Friendly landing page + admin-editable text + best trades – not yet implemented; currently you land directly into the app/login.
	•	⛔ Feature request + voting + roadmap – nothing built yet.
	•	🔧 Dashboard widgets – present and strong, but static; expand/collapse + reordering + persistence still to be designed.
	•	⛔ Community chat – not started; no models, no WebSockets, no UI.

If you like, next step I can propose a concrete implementation order and rough schema/API for:
	1.	Landing page content + best trade endpoints, then
	2.	Feature request + votes,
	3.	Password reset flow,
	4.	Dashboard layout persistence,
	5.	Chat architecture.
