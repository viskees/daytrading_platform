Phase 1 (fast win) — Closed trade summary upgrade

Frontend only
	•	Update closed trade modal to show:
	•	Entry VWAP, Exit VWAP
	•	Max size / total in / total out
	•	Gross P/L, commissions (entry/exit), net P/L
	•	Fix “Size: —” → show max_position_qty (or total_entry_qty)

✅ No backend changes.

Phase 2 — Scaling notes appended into Trade.notes

Backend small change
	•	In TradeViewSet.scale, when a scale occurs:
	•	format a note line
	•	append to trade.notes
	•	save trade

✅ No migrations.
✅ Notes stay “one place”.

⸻

Phase 3 — Scaling screenshots

Frontend
	•	Add ImagePasteDrop to ScaleTradeDialog
	•	After successful scale: upload attachments to same trade id
	•	Caption prefix: “Scale IN/OUT @ price qty”

✅ No backend changes.

⸻

Phase 4 (optional but powerful) — Journal “trade quality” fields

Add a few fields to Trade model:
	•	setup_quality (1–5)
	•	followed_plan (bool)
	•	mistake_tags (json or m2m)
	•	reflection_good, reflection_improve

This is where the journal becomes “coaching-level.”
